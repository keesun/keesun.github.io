<blockquote><p>Defined by Gene Amdahl after he left IBM to found his own company: <span style="font-weight: bold;">“FUD is the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that IBM sales people instill in the minds of potential customers who might be considering [Amdahl] products.”</span> The idea, of course, was to persuade them to go with safe IBM gear rather than with competitors' equipment. This implicit coercion was traditionally accomplished by promising that Good Things would happen to people who stuck with IBM, but Dark Shadows loomed over the future of competitors' equipment or software. See IBM. After 1990 the term FUD was associated increasingly frequently with Microsoft, and has become generalized to refer to any kind of disinformation used as a competitive weapon.</p></blockquote>
<p>번역하다가 등장해서 난항을 겪다가 대엽님 도움으로 알게 됐습니다. 캬오~ 저런 단어가 있었군요. 흠.. 저런 단어는 한글로 옮기기가 좀;; 그냥 FUD라고 쓰고 주석을 달거나, 풀어서 써야겠습니다.</p>
