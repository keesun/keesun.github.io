It said in some rare cases the accelerator padal mechanism could become worn and stick while pressed down.</p>
<p>The same problem, which may cause a car to speed out of control, has lad to a recall of 2.3 million vehicles in North Ameria. Sales have been suspended of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">8</span> eight Toyota models there, include the best-selling Carmly. Productions will be stopped for at least a week in company's fatories in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>In <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">the</span> a seperate move, Toyota is recalling over 5 million vehicles in the United States to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">change</span> replace accelerators which could become stuck under floor <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">mates</span> mats. Some vehicles are affacted by both problems.</p>
