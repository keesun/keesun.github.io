<p>자 오늘도 어디 외운티좀 내 보실까..</p>
<p>For 25 years pizza makers in Naples have been trying to get their product protected, and now it is<span style="color: rgb(227, 22, 0);">, b</span>eing granted a TSG<span style="color: rgb(227, 22, 0);">,</span> or Traditional Specialty Guaranteed label by the EU. The head of <span style="color: rgb(227, 22, 0);">the </span>pizza makers' association said the trademark was a great hono<span style="color: rgb(227, 22, 0);">u</span>r. The EU's agriculture commissioner said <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Naeplizian</span> <span style="color: rgb(227, 22, 0);">Neopolitan</span> pizza was now part of Europe's food heritage.</p>
<p>It means that all pizzerias aspiring to supply the real thing are, in future, supposed to be vetted by a special commission that will check standars. They include <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-decoration: line-through;">only use</span> <span style="color: rgb(227, 22, 0);">using only</span> San Mazarno tomatoes and fresh buffalo <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">mozallera</span> <span style="color: rgb(227, 22, 0);">mozzarella</span> cheese.</p>
<p>The Italian farmers' association says that half of Italy's 25,000 pizzerias currently use the wrong ingredients, like East European's cheese or Ukrainian flour.</p>
<p>Italy now tops the EU chart for products that are protected. It has 180, more then Spain or France. Protected status enables producers to not only <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">boost</span> <span style="color: rgb(227, 22, 0);">boast</span> about theri exclucivity but also charge a premium. Now pizza makers from Naples will get their slice of the action.</p>
