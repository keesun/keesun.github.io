<p>Thousands were left stranded for a second day after the cold weather bought severe disruption to transport across the country.</p>
<p>Some 30 highways have closed in the north of China, and in Beijing the city's Capital airport saw 90% of flights canceled or delayed on Sunday. By early Monday around 40% of flights had been disrupted.</p>
<p>In some parts of Beijing, 33cm of snow fell, the heaviest in more then half a century. Voulunteers have taken to the streeets with snow-shovles to clean the drifts. School children saw their New Year holiday extended by the severe weather. Here and in neighbouring Taizian, they were given the day off.</p>
<p>More snow will be expected across the north of China, although Beijing supposed to be remain clean, but temperature in the capital, already at minus 15, could down even more.</p>
