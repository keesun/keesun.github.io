<p>"Exit Music (For A Film)"</p>
<p>Wake.. from your sleep<br />The drying of your tears<br />Today we escape, we escape</p>
<p>Pack.. and get dressed<br />Before your father hears us<br />Before all hell breaks loose</p>
<p>Breathe, keep breathing<br />Don't lose your nerve<br />Breathe, keep breathing<br />I can't do this alone</p>
<p>Sing.. us a song<br />A song to keep us warm<br />There's such a chill, such a chill</p>
<p>You can laugh<br />A spineless laugh<br />We hope your rules and wisdom choke you<br />Now we are one in everlasting peace</p>
<p>We hope that you choke, that you choke<br />We hope that you choke, that you choke<br />We hope that you choke, that you choke</p>
