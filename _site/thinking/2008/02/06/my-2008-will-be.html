<p>First, I'm now in office with Hibernate and Spring OSGi. I have to tell them first, cause they are now looking at me. They will be my best friends. I want to know Hibernate and Spring, and they also want me to study them. So I think we'll be very good friends</p>
<p>Second. I'm now in office alone. But I'm not lonely and feel compotable. This is my own will. Toby didn't push me stay in office today. :) Here is very compotable and silent. Very good place to study and to work. So I think I'll stay more time in office then home. This can be make nurvous my parents, but I'll explain what's going on. Because my parents always believe me, I can concentrate on what I want to do.</p>
<p>Third. I will expierience many new things. New countries, New peoples. New thoughts and so on. Every time I meet something new, I used to worry about so much. But I decide to do not worry about what'll be happen to me. Even if i worried about it, I should have to accept that. So, I'll not afraid, but study hard to stand all hardships.</p>
<p>I'll do some interesting works. I manage my time by myself. I'll not be in a venity. I'll evolve my skills and expieriences continously. And I'll lose my weight too. :)</p>
<p>Can you belive I can do these? Sorry, I don't mind what other's saying.<br />I believe I can do these and I'll. </p>
<p>Keesun. Fighting!!!</p>
